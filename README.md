# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal in this project is to find out what the highest cause of death is in Canada and if there are any trends across the years that can be seen. 

## Process
Combine data sets together in Tableau.
Made a few visualizations to explore the data. Starting with general world data then moving on to specifically isolating for Canada. Visualizations included tables, bar charts, pie chart, forecasting with a line graph, and also using the world map to identify clusters.

## Results
The dataset I used was "Causes of Death - Our World In Data".
The question I decided to investigate was if there was an increase in deaths in Canada, what the top 10 causes of death were, and in which particular categories/category this was refelected in.

## Challenges 
A challenge I faced in the project was Tableau's limited ability to perform data cleaning. In particular, although nulls were excluded in this project (as they were not used in the sum analysis), it was difficult to filter and replace the nulls with 0. Additionally, the dataset had limitations as well. The data set was divided by country and therefore, when performing cluster analysis, you could not cluster within a country. You could only do cluster analysis between countries. 

## Future Goals
The data only reflected number of deaths, it would be good to analyse this data against number of births to see if there were more deaths compared to births. Additionally, it would be good to see if there were any trends in diseases and correlate them to the findings. Ie. if there was an outbreak for a particular disease at a particular time, we could analyse and see if there was a spike in the number of deaths during that timeframe.
