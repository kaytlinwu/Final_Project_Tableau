# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal in this project was to answer the following questions: 
-What the top cause of death per year is within Canada?
-How does Canada compare to the rest of the world?
-Future considerations?

## Process
Data sets were combined together in Tableau.
Visualizations including line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, world map, and tree maps were made to explore data within the datasets.Data was isolated to select specifically for Canada. Forecasting and clustering was done to further analyse findings from visualizations. 

## Results
Within the kaggle dataset "Causes of Death - Our World In Data", Canada is forecasted to be increasing in number of deaths per year. Diseases are the most significant cause of death with the top 2 leading causes of death found to be Neoplasms and Cardiovascular Diseases. The total number of deaths due to Cardiovascular Diseases was found to be slightly higher than Neoplasms. Compared to the rest of the world, the countries with the highest cluster of deaths by Cardiovascular Disease was the United States, Russia, and India. Canada, in respect to those countries, has much less numbers of death which may be due to the population of Canada being significantly smaller. Finally, a pie chart demonstrates a comprehensive breakdown of total deaths by category and cause can be visualized. 

## Challenges 
Tableau has a limited ability to perform data cleaning. In particular, although nulls were excluded in this project (as they were not used in the sum analysis), it was difficult to filter and replace the nulls with 0. Additionally, the dataset had limitations as well. The data set was divided by country and cause of death therefore, when performing cluster analysis, clusters within a country could not be perfromed. Cluster analysis could only be performed between countries. Limited amounts of graphs could be used to represent the data. 

## Future Goals
Project can be expanded to compare number of deaths to number of births to see if there is a noticeable difference in population numbers. Data can be further broken down by province to see clustering within Canada. More countries can be included to generate more comprehensive analysis. The top 5 causes of death can be utilized to if there is a correlation to lifestyle and see if there is preventable ways to reduce amount of deaths in that category. Cardiovascular deaths were found to be the leading cause of death within Canada, further analysis to build on cardiovascular disease risk and prevention can be performed.
